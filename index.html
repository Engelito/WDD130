    <p>Hello, My name is Angel Gonzalez. I am from chicago Illinois. I enjoy working on 
        creative activities such as illustration, music production and gaming. I enjoy 
        the feeling of understanding a new coding concept and using that informations 
        to create my own projects.

    <p>
        Chicago is one of the third largest city in the united state with LA and New York ahead of it. There 
        is a lot of pride being from Chicago and behind me is the famous bean in Millennium Park but the real
        name for it is "cloud gate", given by the artist behind the design.
